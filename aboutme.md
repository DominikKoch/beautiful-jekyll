After graduating my statistics studies with distinction, I was looking for new challenges in the world of big data.
I'm working as a <strong>Senior Data Scientist</strong> at <a href="https://thinkbiganalytics.com/" target="_blank">Think Big</a>, a Teradata Company. Previously worked also as a Senior Data Scientist in a tiny Data Science startup in Munich. As a data driven problem solver I contributed to the success of many different Data Science projects. Through these projects I also acquired an extensive knowledge of the automotive industry and in the banking sector.
